Learn with me to build a ChatGPT clone from scratch step by step with the use of Semantic Kernel.
This series covers how to setup a backend that talks to OpenAI and connect a frontend to it to
provide an interactive interface for the user. In addition, we will develop a custom plugin to
enrich the default chat experience and we learn to work with the planner.
